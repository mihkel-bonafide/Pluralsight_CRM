# Intended as a learning/teaching tool
This is a rudimentary CRM that is/was part of a Cisco DevNet Associate course
taught on the Pluralsight platform by Nick Russo. Any GitHub activity associated 
with this repo is just me experimenting on a thing. Below is the original 
README text from Nick.                                  <3 -MG, 8.26.25

# Module 2: Learning the Foundations of Software Design
There are two main exercise topics. First, `observer.py` illustrates the
Observer design pattern discussed in the clips. Second, the `mvc/`
directory contains all the files used to build the CRM application.
This follows the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.
